                Hello, I'm Vinh Nguyen, a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree at this institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests are in the area of Computer Systems, where I shoot myself in the foot while programming in C. I enjoy C's simplicity (lol) and how closely I can interact with the hardware
                compared to other languages. I am also decently skilled at C++, and recently I have started to program in Rust.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also enjoy learning other interesting things within the fields of Computer Science, such as creating web pages like this one, training a specialized Machine Learning model, and learning the best practices of Software Engineering.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                In my free times, I enjoy creating and developing simple CLI programs or taking on a project outside of my main area of Computer Systems. I also partake
                in nerd activities such as participating in Hackathons, daily driving with Linux, distro hopping, and customizing my desktop environment while disregarding its ease of use.
