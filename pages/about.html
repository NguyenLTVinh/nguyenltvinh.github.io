                            Hello, I'm <span class="code-keyword">Vinh Nguyen</span>, a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree at this institution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests are in the area of Computer Systems, where I build and program in C. I enjoy C's simplicity and how closely I can interact with the hardware
                            compared to other languages. I am also decently skilled at C++, and recently I have started to program in Rust. With these tools, I make computer programs for myself to use. While I write
                            these programs to learn new things and to hone my skills, I end up using them quite a lot due to how minimal their interfaces are. You can say I'm quite a digital minimalist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite being a "digital minimalist", I am extremely passionate about a wide array of topics within Computer Science.
                            While my main focus is on Computer Systems and low-level programming, I also enjoy learning and taking on other interesting projects
                            such as creating web pages like this one, training a specialized Machine Learning model, and studying the best practices of Software Engineering.

                <h2>Computer Hobbies 💻</h2>
                <p>
                    In my free times, I enjoy creating and developing simple CLI programs or taking on a project outside of my main area of Computer Systems. I also partake
                    in nerd activities such as participating in Hackathons, daily driving with Linux, distro hopping, and customizing my desktop environment while disregarding its ease of use.
